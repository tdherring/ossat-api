### üè† [Demo (Frontend Only)](https://ossat.io/)

## Configuration

These instructions assume you are going to use the default setup (MySQL, SMTP), but you may edit the code to amend the middleware accordingly if desired.

*Settings discussed here can all be found in* `core/settings.py`. 

1. A MySQL database called "ossat" setup on local machine with admin user: "ossat_admin".
   * *Note*: If you are hosting the database remotely, or want to change any of these details, change these in the `DATABASES` section.
2. Two environment variables configured:
   * `OSSAT_DB_PASS` which contains your database password.
   * `OSSAT_EMAIL_ADMIN_PASS` which contains your SMTP user password.
   * `SECRET_KEY` to secure signed data (Optional). 
4. `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`, and all settings `EMAIL_<SETTING>` configured as appropriate. 
5. Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST` to contain the URL and/or IP address of your frontend.
